Description: This package provides functions for fitting graph-GPA 2.0, a novel statistical framework to integrate GWAS datasets for multiple phenotypes and incorporate functional annotations within a unified framework. 'GGPA2' package provides user-friendly interface to fit graph-GPA 2.0 models, implement association mapping, generate a phenotype graph, and implement enrichment analysis for functional annotations.
