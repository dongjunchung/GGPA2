\description{
Fit graph-GPA 2.0 model.
}
\usage{
GGPA2( gwasPval, pgraph=NULL, annotMat = NULL, nBurnin=10000, nMain=40000, lbPval=1e-10, verbose=1 )
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
    \item{gwasPval}{p-value matrix from GWAS data,
		where its row and column correspond to SNP and phenotype, respectively.}
    \item{pgraph}{A binary matrix representing the prior phenotype graph,
		where its rows and columns match the columns of \code{gwasPval}.}
    \item{annotMat}{A binary matrix representing the functional annotation data,
		where its row and column correspond to SNP and annotation, respectively.}
    \item{nBurnin}{Number of burn-in iterations. Default is 10000.}
    \item{nMain}{Number of main MCMC iterations. Default is 40000.}
    \item{lbPval}{Lower bound for GWAS p-value. 
  		Any GWAS p-values smaller than \code{lbPval} are set to \code{lbPval}.
  		Default is 1e-10.}  
    \item{verbose}{Amount of progress report during the fitting procedure. 
  		Possible values are 0 (minimal output), 1, 2, or 3 (maximal output).
  		Default is 1.} 
}
\details{
\code{GGPA2} fits the graph-GPA 2.0 model. It requires to provide GWAS p-value to \code{gwasPval}. If a phenotype graph is provided in \code{pgraph}, it is utilized to guide the phenotype graph estimation. Based on this GGPA2 fit, \code{assoc} implements association mapping and \code{plot} provides a phenotype graph.
